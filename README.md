#🍩 The [NOT OFFICIAL] Tom n Toms Shop Website 🍵#
I’m currently working on an imitation of the popular café chain Tom n Toms ☕🍞. This project is a work-in-progress, aiming to recreate the look and feel of the shop's official website with a few personal touches and enhancements.

📝 Why I Chose It:
I chose this project because I wanted to challenge myself by replicating a well-established commercial site. Tom n Toms has a visually appealing, clean, and modern design that's perfect for sharpening my web development skills 🖥️, especially with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Plus, the site’s content includes menus, locations, and customer service pages, providing an opportunity to practice structuring complex content efficiently.

🚧 Current Status:
🔧 Currently working on the layout and responsiveness.
🎨 Planning to optimize for mobile viewing.
🛠️ Adding some interactive elements and animations.
Stay tuned for updates as I continue developing the site and experimenting with new features!
